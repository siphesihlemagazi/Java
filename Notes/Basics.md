Introduction
- `Every Java program has a class name`
- `The class name of a program must match the filename`
- `And that every program must contain the main() method.`

# Variables are
- `String (inside double qoutes.)`
- `int`
- `float`
- `Boolean`
- `char (single charactors inside single qoutes)`

# Data Types
## These are devided into two chategories;
### Primitive types
Exp - predefined by Java, can be used to call methods to perform operations, always have a value, starts with lowercase latter, size depend on datatype.
- `int - whole number between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647`
- `boolean - true false`
- `char - single character/letter or ASCII values`
- `float - fractional numbers with 6 to 7 decimal digits`
- `byte - whole numbers from -128 to 127`
- `long -  whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807`
- `double - fractional numbers with 15 decimal digits`
- `short - whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767`

### None Primitive Types
Exp - defined by dev except for String, cannot be used call certain method to perform operations, their value can be null, starts with uppercase letter, all have the same size.
- `String`
- `Class`
- `Array`

# Type Casting
## There are 2 type of type casting
### Widening  Casting - converts small type to large type.
- `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`
- `Happens automatically - int x = 8; double y = x`
### Narrowing  Casting - converts large type to small type.
- `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`
- `Is manually done - double x = 8; int y = (int) x`

# Operators
- `Arithmetic operators`
- `Assignment operators`
- `Comparison operators`
- `Logical operators`
- `Bitwise operators`

# String Methods
- `Check length - String x = "Hello"; x.length();.`
- `Convert case - String x = "Hello"; x.toUpperCase(); x.toLowerCase();`
- `Find charator(s) - String x = "Hello"; x.indefOf('llo');`
- `Concatinate - String x = "Hello"; String y = " Bob"; x.concat(y);`

# Math
- `This give you a random number - int randomNum = Math.random();`
