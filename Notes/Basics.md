Introduction
- `Every Java program has a class name`
- `The class name of a program must match the filename`
- `And that every program must contain the main() method.`

# Variables are
- `String (inside double qoutes.)`
- `int`
- `float`
- `Boolean`
- `char (single charactors inside single qoutes)`

# Data Types
## These are devided into two chategories;
### Primitive types
Exp - predefined by Java, can be used to call methods to perform operations, always have a value, starts with lowercase latter, size depend on datatype.
- `int - whole number between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647`
- `boolean - true false`
- `char - single character/letter or ASCII values`
- `float - fractional numbers with 6 to 7 decimal digits`
- `byte - whole numbers from -128 to 127`
- `long -  whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807`
- `double - fractional numbers with 15 decimal digits`
- `short - whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767`

### None Primitive Types
Exp - defined by dev except for String, cannot be used call certain method to perform operations, their value can be null, starts with uppercase letter, all have the same size.
- `String`
- `Class`
- `Array`

# Type Casting
## There are 2 type of type casting
### Widening  Casting - converts small type to large type.
- `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`
- `Happens automatically - int x = 8; double y = x`
### Narrowing  Casting - converts large type to small type.
- `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`
- `Is manually done - double x = 8; int y = (int) x`

# Operators
- `Arithmetic operators`
- `Assignment operators`
- `Comparison operators`
- `Logical operators`
- `Bitwise operators`

# String Methods
- `Check length - String x = "Hello"; x.length();.`
- `Convert case - String x = "Hello"; x.toUpperCase(); x.toLowerCase();`
- `Find charator(s) - String x = "Hello"; x.indefOf('llo');`
- `Concatinate - String x = "Hello"; String y = " Bob"; x.concat(y);`

# Math
- `This give you a random number - int randomNum = Math.random();`

# If Else Shot hand
- `String result = (10 < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";`

# Switch 
- `Used to avoid many if else statements.`
```
int day = 2
switch(day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
}
```
# While Loop
- `There are 2 type of while loop, while loop an do while`
```
While loop runs the code as long as the condition is true

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
```
```
A do while first run the code then check the condition
  
int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
```

# For Loop
```
Mostly used when you know how many times you want to loop

for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

# For-Each Loop
```
"For-each" loop is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array`

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

# Arrays
- `Defined as String[] cars;`
- `With elements - String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};`

# For Loop in an Array
```
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(cars[i]);
}
```

# For Each Loop in an Array
```
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

# Keywords you should be able to explain and give examples for, before OOP.
### abstract
- `Used for both classes and methods.`
- `An abstract class cannot be used to create objects, you can only access its methods and properties from a class that extends it`
- `An abstract method does not have a body and it can be only be used inside an abstract class. The body of an abstract method is provided inside the class that extends the class which the method belongs to.`
### extends
- `Indicates that a class is inherited from another class.`
### enum
- `A special "class" that represents a group of constant variables.`
### interface
- `An abstract "class" that is used to group related methods with "empty" bodies.`
- `On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods.`
- `Interface methods are by default abstract and public.`
- `Interface attributes are by default public, static and final.`
- `An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects).`
### implement
- `This is a keyword used like the extend keyword, it is used on an interface to access its methods.`
### super
- `Used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.`
### this
- `Refers to the current object, like self in Python.`
### void
- `Specifies that a method does not have a return value.`
### protected
- `An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)`
### public
- `An access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)`
### class
- `A detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But not the object itself.`
### Object 
- `A class becomes an object only when it is instatiated. This is also when memory is allocated.`
